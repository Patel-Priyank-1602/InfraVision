Green Hydrogen InfraVision: Play, Plan, and Prove Impact
Project Overview
Green Hydrogen InfraVision is an interactive web-based tool designed to revolutionize the planning and optimization of green hydrogen infrastructure. In the face of accelerating climate goals, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen production plants, storage facilities, pipelines, and distribution hubs is crucial. This platform addresses the challenge by providing a map-centric interface that visualizes existing and planned assets alongside renewable energy sources, demand centers, and transport logistics. It empowers users to make data-driven decisions for new investments, ensuring efficient growth of the hydrogen ecosystem.
Built for urban and regional planners, energy companies, project developers, and policy analysts, InfraVision combines gamification, AI intelligence, and impact metrics to make infrastructure planning engaging, smart, and measurable. By directing capital to high-yield projects, it minimizes redundant investments, optimizes land use, and supports net-zero ambitions. The tool transforms abstract data into actionable insights, fostering coordinated development of hydrogen networks.
Key Features
InfraVision integrates three core functionalities to create a "killer combo": gamified optimization for fun interactivity, AI-assisted site suggestions for futuristic planning, and a sustainability impact dashboard for real-world climate benefits.

Gamified Optimization
To make planning accessible and engaging, users can drag and drop hydrogen plant markers directly onto an interactive map. This feature turns site selection into a playful experience, ideal for hackathon demos or collaborative sessions. Upon dropping a marker:

The backend instantly calculates a suitability score based on rule-based criteria, such as proximity to renewable energy sources (e.g., solar or wind farms), industrial demand hubs, existing pipelines, and regulatory zones.
Scores are displayed prominently, e.g., "78/100 – Good Site ✅," with color-coded feedback (green for high suitability, red for poor).
This adds "playability," allowing users like judges or planners to test ideas in real-time, experiment with scenarios, and iterate on placements. It avoids static maps by encouraging dynamic interaction, making the tool feel like a strategy game while grounding decisions in data.


AI-Assisted Site Suggestion
Leveraging artificial intelligence, InfraVision provides proactive recommendations to guide investments. An AI model—built with scikit-learn's Decision Tree or Random Forest algorithms—is trained on a mock dataset incorporating factors like renewable capacity, market demand, cost estimates, and environmental constraints.

Pre-computed "best sites" are highlighted on the map with glowing overlays or pins, e.g., "These 3 regions are where AI suggests building next."
Users can query the AI for custom suggestions based on parameters like budget or scale, receiving ranked options with explanations (e.g., "Site A: High renewable access, low transport costs").
This creates a "wow factor" by blending machine learning with energy planning, enabling users to discover optimal locations that might otherwise be overlooked. It's particularly useful for policy analysts evaluating large-scale deployments.


Sustainability Impact Dashboard
Every site—whether AI-suggested or user-placed—comes with a dedicated dashboard panel that quantifies environmental and economic benefits. Metrics are calculated using simple backend formulas and displayed via intuitive charts:

CO₂ Saved (tons/year): Based on assumptions like 1 ton of green hydrogen offsetting ~10 tons of CO₂ through clean energy substitution.
Industries Supported (#): Counts nearby demand centers, such as steel mills or transport fleets that could adopt hydrogen.
% Renewable Utilization: Measures how much local solar, wind, or other renewables the site can leverage, promoting efficient resource use.
The dashboard appears on click, featuring visualizations like bar graphs for CO₂ reductions or pie charts for energy mixes. This impact-driven approach ensures decisions are tied to tangible climate outcomes, helping users pitch projects with evidence of sustainability.



Demo Flow
The platform is judge-friendly and demo-ready:

Open the Map: Users are greeted with a layered visualization showing current hydrogen plants, renewables, pipelines, and demand zones.
AI Glow: AI automatically highlights top suggested sites for immediate insights.
User Interaction: Drag and drop a plant marker; watch as the system computes and displays the suitability score.
Dashboard Dive: Click any site to reveal impact metrics, complete with charts and stats.
Pitch Mode: Summarize scenarios, e.g., "This user-placed site saves 50,000 tons of CO₂ annually while supporting 5 industries."

This flow takes under 5 minutes, emphasizing interactivity and results.
Why It Stands Out
While other prototypes might offer basic maps with markers, InfraVision elevates the experience to a decision-support product. It's interactive (judges can drag-drop and score live), AI-powered (for smart suggestions), and impact-focused (proving climate benefits). This combination feels professional yet innovative, positioning it as a scalable tool for real-world hydrogen expansion. In a hackathon, it shines by letting evaluators "play" while demonstrating measurable value—avoiding generic demos and highlighting coordinated, efficient growth.
Tech Stack

Frontend (Map + UI + Gamification): React with Leaflet.js or Mapbox for smooth, responsive mapping and drag-drop interactions.
AI Model (Site Suggestion): Python with scikit-learn, served via FastAPI or Flask.
Impact Calculator: Python backend for real-time computations.
Dashboard: Chart.js or Recharts integrated into React for dynamic visualizations.
Deployment: Frontend on Vercel; backend on Render or Heroku for quick setup.

This stack ensures a full-fledged website that's hackathon-viable: fast, scalable, and easy to deploy. InfraVision not only maps the future of green hydrogen but invites users to shape it interactively.
