## 🚀 Project Overview

Identifying where to grow the hydrogen ecosystem requires more than just maps. This project offers a **gamified, AI-powered, and impact-driven** platform that:

* Visualizes **existing and planned assets** (plants, pipelines, storage, renewable hubs).
* Uses **AI models** to suggest optimal new site locations.
* Lets users **play with site placement** and see real-time suitability scores.
* Displays a **sustainability impact dashboard** with climate and economic metrics.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎮 1. Gamified Optimization

* Drag & drop hydrogen plant markers on the map.
* Get instant **suitability scores** (based on renewables, pipelines, demand hubs).
* Judges and users can interact in real-time → fun + insightful.

### 🤖 2. AI-Assisted Site Suggestion

* AI model (Decision Tree / Random Forest with mock data).
* Pre-computed **"best site" highlights** glow on the map.
* AI suggests top 3 regions → futuristic + data-driven planning.

### 📊 3. Sustainability Impact Dashboard

* Every site (AI-suggested or user-placed) shows:

  * **CO₂ saved (tons/year)** 🌱
  * **Industries Supported (#)** 🏭
  * **% Renewable Utilization** ☀️💨
* Visualized with interactive charts & stats → easy to pitch impact.

---

## 🎯 Demo Flow

1. Open Map → Explore hydrogen assets & renewable hubs.
2. See AI Glow → Top 3 AI-suggested sites appear.
3. Drag & Drop → Place your own plant & get suitability score.
4. Dashboard → View CO₂ savings, industries supported, and renewables usage.
5. Pitch → Showcase how the platform drives **net-zero growth**.

---

## ⚡ Why It Stands Out

* Others: static maps with markers.
* **InfraVision:** interactive + gamified + AI-powered + measurable climate impact.
* Judges can **try it live** → immediate wow factor.
* Feels like a **decision-support product**, not just a prototype.
