## 🔹 Project Description

**Problem:**  
Planning and expanding green hydrogen infrastructure is complex. Urban planners, energy companies, and policymakers often lack interactive tools that combine mapping, AI insights, and impact analysis for optimal decision-making.

**Our Solution:**  
**Green Hydrogen InfraVision** is an interactive, gamified, AI-powered platform for **mapping, optimizing, and analyzing green hydrogen infrastructure**. Users can explore existing and planned hydrogen assets, experiment with site placement, and visualize sustainability impacts in real-time.
